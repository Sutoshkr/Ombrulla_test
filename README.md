# Object Detection with Prompt Generation

This project implements an object detection model that identifies various objects in images  and generates relevant prompts based on the detected objects.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies multiple objects in input images.
- **Prompt Generation**: Automatically generates prompts or descriptions based on detected objects.
- **Supports multiple object categories**: Can detect various predefined objects such as people, cars, animals, etc.
